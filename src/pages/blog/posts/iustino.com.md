Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I built this website from scratch using React and Tailwind CSS. It will be where I showcase my creative work. I want to use this website to document my learnings and discoveries. I hope this website encourages me to read more books and papers, consolidating my knowledge by explaining it in my own words.

I hope that through writing, I can learn to organize my thoughts better. Programming, after all, is about organizing thoughts and translating them into code.

Lastly, some acknowledgments:
- All photos on this website are my own.
- The design is inspired by the homepage of Klim Type Foundry.
- Gallery design is inspired by Hedi Slimane Diary.
- The font used is SÃ¶hne, also by Klim Type Foundry.
