## Some opening words

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I built this website from scratch using React and Tailwind CSS, and I plan to transform it into a platform where I can freely express myself. For now, it serves as a portfolio showcasing my projects and hobbies. Currently, I'm investing a lot of time in photography, and I want to reflect that on this site. It’s also a place for documenting my daily learnings, random thoughts, and discoveries. I hope this website encourages me to read more books and papers, consolidating my knowledge by explaining it in my own words.

In the future, I aim to use this platform to host my projects. While I create them to solve personal problems, I hope that by making them public, they might help others too.

Now, let me share a bit about why I chose to create my own platform instead of using existing ones.

I've had a Twitter account for years, primarily for occasional content browsing. Recently, a friend suggested that I start posting to build my online credentials. While I agree with the idea, I never knew what to post. I often found myself quoting or reposting interesting tweets without a solid base for my thoughts. The character limit was also a constraint, forcing me to sacrifice depth for brevity. I believe this limitation encourages bite-sized content optimized for engagement rather than thoughtful discourse. I joined Twitter to discover valuable insights but ended up overwhelmed by noise.

Beyond Twitter, I couldn't find a suitable place for thoughtful content. If I were to write blogs on platforms like Medium or Substack, I might as well create my own website to customize the entire experience to my liking.

Additionally, I hope that through writing, I can learn to organize my thoughts better. Programming, after all, is about organizing thoughts and translating them into code.

Lastly, some acknowledgments:
- All photos on this website are my own.
- The design is inspired by the homepage of Klim Type Foundry.
- The font used is Söhne[^1], also by Klim Type Foundry.
[^1]: I'm technically using their test font, as the official Söhne font collection costs more than 1500 USD. The test fonts only support a limited character set, so you might notice some differences in punctuation characters.
